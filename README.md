# Circa-in-Silico
Circa in Silico is a web-based application that uses standard algorithms to render synthetic circadian mRNA transcript data sets for a multifaceted approach to studying circadian rhythms. 

Getting Started:

Click on the boxes on the left to manipulate the parameters by either entering a value or using the arrows.
After programming the desired values, use the "Download" button to retrieve the raw data file for local visualisation on a variety of platforms (R, MatLab, Excel, etc).
